This course on the Application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in Urban Systems is designed for SEM 10 BArch students. It focuses on enhancing students' abilities to analyze, interpret, and visualize spatial data in urban planning and architecture contexts. Students will engage with GIS to explore spatial patterns, connections, and trends within urban environments, applying this knowledge to real-world urban planning scenarios.

## Course Overview

This 2-credit course is structured around 24 total hours of lectures, distributed across several key topics in GIS. Each lecture is designed to build on the previous, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of GIS applications in urban planning.

## Course Outline

### Week 1-2: Introduction to GIS (4 hours)
- Overview of GIS, its importance, and applications in urban planning
- Introduction to GIS software and interfaces
- Spatial data types: vector and raster

### Week 3-4: Data in GIS (4 hours)
- Spatial data collection methods and sources
- Data quality, storage, formats, and organization in GIS
- Introduction to data layering and management

### Week 5-6: Spatial Analysis using GIS (4 hours)
- Analyzing land use patterns and transportation networks
- Overlay analysis, buffering, and proximity analysis techniques

### Week 7-8: GIS for Urban Systems Analysis (4 hours)
- Mapping and analyzing urban systems (e.g., infrastructure, utilities)
- Techniques for infrastructure coverage and capacity analysis

### Week 9-10: GIS for Master Plan and Zoning Analysis (4 hours)
- Mapping zoning regulations and master plan provisions
- Analysis of compliance with zoning and master plans

### Week 11-12: Visualizing and Interpreting GIS Results (4 hours)
- Creating impactful visualizations (maps, charts)
- Interpreting GIS analyses for urban planning decisions

## Final Project Workshop (4 hours)
- Application of learned GIS skills to a final project
- Focus on a specific aspect of urban planning or analysis

## Lecture Plan

The course is divided into detailed lectures that cover the breadth of GIS applications in urban systems. Each session will include theoretical foundations, practical demonstrations, and hands-on exercises where students apply learned concepts to urban planning scenarios.

### Key Topics Include:
- Basics of GIS and its significance in urban planning
- Spatial data types, collection, and management
- Advanced spatial analysis techniques
- Application of GIS in analyzing and planning urban infrastructure
- Master plan and zoning analysis through GIS
- Techniques for effective visualization and interpretation of GIS data
- Comprehensive project work, integrating GIS skills into urban planning analysis

Upon completion of this course, students will have a solid foundation in GIS, equipped with the skills to apply spatial analysis to urban planning projects, enhancing their capacity to make data-driven decisions in their future professional practice.
